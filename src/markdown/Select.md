&nbsp;

For drawing the rectangle first click on the starting point, drag the cursor until reaching the desire size/area and then, release the mouse button. After drawn, the rectangle shape/dimensions can be edited by selecting one of the editing squares around the shape. At this point, the shapes features have not been saved and require the execution of the command StopSelect for storing the rectangle coordinates in memory.

&nbsp;

The following conditions need to be fulfilled:

&nbsp;

&#49;. OpenDSS-GIS must be installed

&#50;. OpenDSS-GIS must be initialized (use GIS Start command)

&#51;. The model needs to have the correct GISCoords file
