# Meters

Meters are objects crated for recording values across the circuit model during the simulation. These values can be exported at the end of the simulation or can be used by controls to collect data that will be used for performing control actions. Some meters have additional functionalities that affect not only the monitored element but the whole circuit. The inheritance tree for the existing general-purpose elements is shown in Figure 8 (classes) and Figure 9 (objects).
