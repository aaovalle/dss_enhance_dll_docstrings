# Updating OpenDSS

&nbsp;

A new version of the Installer is created for major releases. This can be downloaded from Sourceforge.net. In between major releases beta builds are posted on the main website. This normally be in these locations:

&nbsp;

[https://sourceforge.net/p/electricdss/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/Version8/Distrib/x64/](<https://sourceforge.net/p/electricdss/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/Version8/Distrib/x64/>)

[https://sourceforge.net/p/electricdss/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/Version8/Distrib/x86/](<https://sourceforge.net/p/electricdss/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/Version8/Distrib/x86/>)

&nbsp;

for the 64-bit and 32-bit versions, respectively.

&nbsp;

You may update to the latest beta build simply by copying the desired EXE or DLL files over the ones previoiusly installed by the Installer.

&nbsp;

Be sure to not mix X64 and X86 versions as these will not work on the opposite type of system.
