# Parallel

&nbsp;

This interface can be used to gain access to the features of the parallel processing suite included in OpenDSS through the Parallel interface. This interface is embedded within the ActiveCircuit interface, requiring the definition of this interface before getting access the to Parallel interface.

&nbsp;

*Example*

&nbsp;

% Create DSS object

DSSObject = actxserver('OpenDSSEngine.DSS')

if ~DSSObject.Start(0),

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; disp("Unable to start openDSS");

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return

end;

DSSCircuit = DSSObject.ActiveCircuit;

DSSParallel = DSSCircuit.Parallel;
