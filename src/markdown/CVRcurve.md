# CVRcurve

&nbsp;

(read/write)

&nbsp;

This property sets/gets the name of a loadshape with both Mult and Qmult, for CVR factors as a function of time. Default is NONE. This curve describes both watt and var factors as a function of time. Refers to a LoadShape object with both Mult and Qmult defined. Define a Loadshape to agree with yearly or daily curve according to the type of analysis being done. If NONE, the CVRwatts and CVRvars factors are used and assumed constant.

&nbsp;

*Example*

&nbsp;

% Create DSS object

DSSObject = actxserver('OpenDSSEngine.DSS')

if ~DSSObject.Start(0),

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; disp('Unable to start openDSS');

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return

end;

DSSText = DSSObject.Text;

DSSCircuit = DSSObject.ActiveCircuit;

% Compile a model &nbsp; &nbsp;

DSSText.Command = 'Compile C:\\myPath\\myModel.dss';

DSSLoads = DSSCircuit.Loads;

% activates the first load on the list

i = DSSLoads.First;

% gets the name of the CVRCurve for the active load

myCVRCurve = DSSLoads.CVRcurve;
