| ***Message generator*** | ***Error code*** | ***Message*** | ***How to deal with it*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Circuit.pas | &#55;006 | 'tear\_circuit','metis cannot start.', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'the metis program is not supported in fpc; tfilesearchreplace is unavailable.' | The user is trying to tear apart the circuit model either for creating sub-circuits or for using A-Diakoptics. This process required the Metis application within the OpenDSS Directory but is not there. Check if the file is in there and try again. |
| Circuit.pas | &#55;007 | 'tear\_circuit','the graph file is incorrect.', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'metis cannot process the graph file because is incorrect' + &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '(the number of edges is incorrect).' | When tearing the circuit model using the incidence matrix produced by OpenDSS there was an issue. Metis returned an error message indicating that the graph is incorrect. Look for isolated areas and try again. |
| Circuit.pas | &#52;24 | 'tdsscircuit.addbus', 'busname for object "' + activecktelement.name + '" is null.',&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'error in definition of object.' | When declaring an element, it is important to provide an accurate description of the connection to the bus. This message signals that the bus definition is incorrect, either because it has special characters in the name such as dots (.) or spaces ( ) additional to the standard declaration. Review this features and try again. |
| CktElement.pas | &#55;51 | 'something is wrong.&nbsp; got to base cktelement getcurrents for object:'+crlf+dssclassname+'.'+name, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'n/a', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'should not be able to get here. probable programming error.' | There was a problem calculating the active element’s currents, this can be triggered due to an issue in the last solution. There was no solution, or the voltage vector is equal to 0 at the connection points of the element. Check if the last solution converged and try again. |
| CktElement.pas | &#55;52 | 'something is wrong.&nbsp; got to base cktelement getinjcurrents for object:'+crlf+dssclassname+'.'+name, '\*\*\*\*', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'should not be able to get here. probable programming error.' | There was a problem retrieving the active element’s injection currents, this can be triggered due to an issue in the last solution. There was no solution, or the voltage vector is equal to 0 at the connection points of the element. Check if the last solution converged and try again. If the problem is not solved, there must be an internal issue that needs to be reviewed. |
| CktElement.pas | &#55;53 | ('improper call to injcurrents for element: ' + name + '.'), '\*\*\*\*',&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'called cktelement class base function instead of actual.' | The element declaration is not adequate or the procedure for retrieving the active element’s injection currents vector is not correct. This is an internal error and likely to be produced due to an error in the declaration/implementation of a new functionality. |
| DSSClass.pas | &#55;80 | 'reached base class of tdssclass for device "'+objname+'"', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'n/a', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'should be overridden.' | The element declared does not overrides the procedures/functions that should be part of the unit’s base. This error is triggered when creating new objects within OpenDSS and is telling the developer that the unit is incomplete, suggesting that one or several inherited procedures/functions need to be override. |
| DSSGlobals.pas | &#57;06 | 'makenewcircuit',&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'cannot create new circuit.',&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'max. circuits exceeded.'+crlf+&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '(max no. of circuits='+inttostr(maxcircuits)+')' | When cloning an existing circuit or compiling a new one in a different actor there is a limit in the number of threads (Actors) that can be created. In OpenDSS the limit is the number of threads available per processor, this to guarantee dedicated resources when doing things like Real-time. However, if users feel confident, they can remove this constraint from the code to generate their own versions. This is not critical, but a reminder of this constraint added. |
| DSSGlobals.pas | &#55;000 | 'makenewcircuit',&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'cannot create new circuit.',&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'all the available cpus have being assigned' | When cloning an existing circuit or compiling a new one in a different actor there is a limit in the number of threads (Actors) that can be created. In OpenDSS the limit is the number of threads available per processor, this to guarantee dedicated resources when doing things like Real-time. However, if users feel confident, they can remove this constraint from the code to generate their own versions. This is not critical, but a reminder of this constraint added. |
| Feeder.pas | &#54;32 | ('getcurrents for feeder element: ' + name + '.'), e.message,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'inadequate storage allotted for circuit element?' | There was an error when allocating memory for one of the variables for a declared element. This error is an implementation error, meaning that one of the default values is not assigned or is not properly allocated when declaring the object. |
| Utilities.pas | &#55;04 | 'fireoffeditor.', e.message, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'default editor correctly specified???' | The default text editor program does not exist or is not located at the given location. Check this out with the command set/get editor in OpenDSS. |
| Utilities.pas | &#55;09 | 'error opening '+filename+' for writing.', e.message, ' file protected or other file error.' | There was a problem opening/writing the file mentioned in the message. It is likely that the file is read only or is located at a protected location. If so, move the file to another public access location. |
| Utilities.pas | &#55;10 | 'error opening '+filename + ' for writing.', e.message, 'disk protected or other file error' | There was a problem opening/writing the file mentioned in the message. It is likely that the file is read only or is located at a protected location. If so, move the file to another public access location. |
| CapControl.pas | &#51;61 | 'capcontrol: "' + self.name + '"', 'capacitor element "'+ controlvars.capacitorname + '" not found.',&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' element must be defined previously.' | The user is declaring a new capcontrol but the capacitor assigned for control does not exist in the active circuit.

Capacitors are 2 terminal elements, suggesting that the terminal value can only be 1 or 2. Check if there is a typo in the terminal number entered for the capacitor provided and make sure the capacitor was declared before the capcontrol declaration. |
