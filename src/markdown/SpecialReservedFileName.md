# Special Reserved File Name 

\
The name %result% is now used to designate the last result file. For example, if you want to export a file (such as a monitor file) and then immediately read in column 5 to do something with, you could do it with the following syntax:

&nbsp;

...mult=\[File=%result%, Column=5, Header=Yes\]

&nbsp;

This must be executed before another command is issued that writes a result file.
