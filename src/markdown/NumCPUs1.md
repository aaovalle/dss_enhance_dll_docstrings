Returns the number of threads of virtual cores (CPUs) available in the computer. This is a read-only value and must be executed using the “Get” command (opposite of the Set command). The number of CPUs will be equal to the number of threads of the active processor multiplied by the number of NUMA nodes. For more information about the processor architecture visit:&nbsp;
