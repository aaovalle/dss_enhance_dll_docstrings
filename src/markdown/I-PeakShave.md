# I-PeakShave

The operation principle in I-PeakShave mode is similar to the PeakShave mode, except that the control attempts to discharge storage to keep **current** in the monitored element below the target given in k-amps (thousands of amps). When this control mode is active, the property *kWTarget* will be expressed in k-amps and all the other parameters will be adjusted to match the amps (current) control criteria.
