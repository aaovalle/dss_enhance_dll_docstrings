# Transformer 

&nbsp;

**Transformer Object**

&nbsp;

The Transfomer is implemented as a multi-terminal (two or more) power delivery element.

&nbsp;

A transfomer consists of two or more Windings, connected in somewhat arbitrary fashion (with a default Wye-Delta connection). You can specify the parameters one winding at a time or use arrays to set all the winding values at once. Use the "wdg=â€¦" parameter to select a winding for editing.

&nbsp;

Note that you can define an XfmrCode object to define a Transformer object. This will same some coding in large circuits where many transformers are identical.

&nbsp;

Transformers have one or more phases. The number of conductors per terminal is always one more than the number of phases. For wye- or star-connected windings, the extra conductor is the neutral point. For delta-connected windings, the extra terminal is open internally (you normally leave this connected to node 0).
