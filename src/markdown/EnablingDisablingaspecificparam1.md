# Enabling/Disabling a specific parameter

&nbsp;

As mentioned earlier, [Figure 2](<OpenDSSDocumentation.md#\_bookmark2>) shows the inverter capability curve resulting from the use of all possible properties. To generate simpler curves, OpenDSS allows some of the properties to be disabled. [Figure 3](<OpenDSSDocumentation.md#\_bookmark3>) describes possible modifications to the capability curve by enabling/disabling the *%PminNoVars*, *%PminkvarLimit* and *varFollowInverter*. For simplicity, the resulting capability curve is shown for operation in first quadrant only (the disabling of any parameter also affects the capability curve in the other quadrants). Note that *%CutOut* and *varFollowInverter* can also be disabled.
