# Rneut

&nbsp;

(read/write)

&nbsp;

This property sets/gets the resistance in OHMS of the active Winding Neutral&nbsp; resistor of wye (star)-connected winding. If entered as a negative value, the neutral is assumed to be open, or floating. To solidly ground the neutral, connect the neutral conductor to Node 0 in the Bus property spec for this winding. For example: Bus=MyBusName.1.2.3.0, which is generally the default connection. Default = -1. This is an illegal values to simply designate that the neutral is floating and connected according to the bus definition. This is the common case for most OpenDSS circuit definitions.

&nbsp;

*Example*

&nbsp;

% Create DSS object

DSSObject = actxserver('OpenDSSEngine.DSS')

if ~DSSObject.Start(0),

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; disp('Unable to start openDSS');

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return

end;

DSSText = DSSObject.Text;

DSSCircuit = DSSObject.ActiveCircuit;

% Compile a model &nbsp; &nbsp;

DSSText.Command = 'Compile C:\\myPath\\myModel.dss';

DSSXfmr = DSSCircuit.Transformers;

% Activates the first transformer on the list

i = DSSXfmr.First;

% Activates the first winding of the active transformer

DSSXfmr.Wdg = 1;

% gets the Rneut for the active transformer

for j = 1:DSSXfmr.NumWindings,

&nbsp; &nbsp; DSSXfmr.Wdg = j;

&nbsp; &nbsp; disp(\['Winding ', num2str(j),' has Rneut = ', num2str(DSSXfmr.Rneut)\]);

end;
