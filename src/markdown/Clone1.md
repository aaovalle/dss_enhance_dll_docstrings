&nbsp;

This command clones the active circuit as many times as specified in the argument, for example, Clone 4 will create 4 actors with the same model as the one in memory at the time “Clone” is invoked. The argument needs to be a positive number greater than 0. If the number of clones requested exceeds the number of CPUs, OpenDSS will deliver and error message (7001).
