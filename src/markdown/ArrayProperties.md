# Array Properties

\
Array parameters are sequences of numbers. Of necessity, delimiters must be present to separate the numbers. To define an array, simply enclose the sequence in any of the quote pairs. Square brackets, \[..\], are the preferred method, although any of the other quote pairs: “..”, ‘..’, (..), {..} will work. For example, for a 3-winding transformer you could define arrays such as:

&nbsp;

...kvs = \[115, 6.6, 22\]

...kvas=\[20000 16000 16000\]
