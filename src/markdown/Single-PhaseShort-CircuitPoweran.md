# Single-Phase Short-Circuit Power and Current Calculation

&nbsp;

In this section, *S*¯*sc*1 and *I*˙*sc*1 are calculated considering that the *Vsource* element is at a single-phase short-circuit condition in phase *A*, as shown in [Figure 5](<Single-PhaseShort-CircuitPoweran.md#\_bookmark19>).

The single-phase short-circuit current can be defined as:

From [Figure 5](<Single-PhaseShort-CircuitPoweran.md#\_bookmark19>), applying KVL on phase *A*, one can obtain:

From Equation 20, it is possible to obtain the single-phase short-circuit current magnitude as function of the magnitude of the self-impedance:

The single-phase short-circuit power is defined as follows.

The single-phase short-circuit power magnitude can be obtained as function of the magnitude of the self-impedance:

To obtain *S*¯*sc*1 and *I*˙*sc*1 as function of *Z*¯0 e *Z*¯1, the relation between *Z*¯*s* and the pair *Z*¯0 and *Z*¯1 suffice, as shown in [Equation 26](<Single-PhaseShort-CircuitPoweran.md#\_bookmark23>), derived from the relations found in ([8](<SequenceImpedancesComputationfro.md#\_bookmark9>)).
