# EEN and UE Definitions

\
EEN refers to load energy considered unserved because the current or voltage exceeds Normal ratings. UE refers to load energy considered unserved because the power (actually the current) exceeds Emergency, or maximum, ratings.

&nbsp;

On radial systems (default), a load is marked as unserved with respect to either normal or emergency ratings if either:

&nbsp;

• The voltage at the load bus is below minimum ratings

&nbsp;

• The current in any power delivery element supplying the load exceeds the current ratings.

&nbsp;

• Either the entire load or just the portion above rating at the bus that is considered unserved is counted as unserved, depending on whether the Excess option or the Total option have been specified.
