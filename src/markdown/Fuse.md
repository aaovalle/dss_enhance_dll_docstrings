# Fuse

&nbsp;

A fuse is an electrical safety device that operates to provide over-current protection of an electrical circuit. Its essential component is a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows through it, thereby stopping or interrupting the current. It is a sacrificial device; once a fuse has operated it is an open circuit, and must be replaced or rewired, depending on its type.&nbsp;
