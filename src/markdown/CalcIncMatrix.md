# CalcIncMatrix

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This command can be used to calculate the Branch-To-Node incidence matrix (B2N) of the active circuit. The calculation is performed considering the PDElements as branches (rows) and the buses as nodes (Columns). The order of the PDElements as rows goes as follows: Lines, transformers, capacitors in series and reactors in series.
