# Distance

&nbsp;

Returns the linear distance in meters between two coordinates. The coordinates must be defined using GISCoords. This command doesnâ€™t have arguments, but it requires the user to previously define the coordinates for the area of interest as follows:

&nbsp;

set GISCoords = \[40.50007607834282197,-80.01294794446681635, 40.50019376002214955, -80.01323963543782725\]

GIS Distance

&nbsp;

When combined with the command LoadBus, if the first coordinates in the previous example correspond to myBus1 and the second pair to myBus2, GISDistance will look as follows:

&nbsp;

GIS LoadBus myBus1 \!uploads bus1 coords into the buffer

GIS LoadBus myBus2 \!uploads bus2 coords into the buffer

GIS Distance

&nbsp;

The following conditions need to be fulfilled:

&nbsp;

&#49;. OpenDSS-GIS must be installed

&#50;. OpenDSS-GIS must be initialized (use GIS Start command)
