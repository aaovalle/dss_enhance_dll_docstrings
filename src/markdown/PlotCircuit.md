# PlotCircuit

&nbsp;

With this command the user can plot the modelâ€™s schematic on top of the map. OpenDSS-GIS will zoom in the map to display the entire model. The schematic draw will follow the features set when assigning values to options GISColor and GISThickness. By default, GISColor ir red (FF0000) and GISThickness is 3. Consider the model proposed in Figure 25.

&nbsp;

After executing GISPlotCircuit the model schematic will be display in OpenDSS-GIS as shown at Figure 25

&nbsp;

Now, suppose you want to change the circuit line color to blue and make the model thinner, set GISColor = 0000FF (blue) and GISThickness = 1. The output will be as shown at Figure 26.
