Release version installers are posted at irregular intervals. If you have a Delphi compiler, up-to-date versions may be built from the source code, which contains the latest changes. If you don't have a compiler that can build the program, the latest beta builds are posted at these locations:

&nbsp;

[http://svn.code.sf.net/p/electricdss/code/trunk/Distrib/x86/](<http://svn.code.sf.net/p/electricdss/code/trunk/Distrib/x86/>) (32-bit version)

[http://svn.code.sf.net/p/electricdss/code/trunk/Distrib/x64/](<http://svn.code.sf.net/p/electricdss/code/trunk/Distrib/x64/>) (64-bit version)

&nbsp;

The latest build is generally just fine and you may need it to access the latest features reported in the Wiki. However, there is a small risk some bug has crept into the code as changes were made. Report any problems as soon as possible.
