# Matrix Properties

\
Matrix parameters are entered by extending the Array syntax: Simply place a vertical bar (\|) character between rows, for example:

&nbsp;

...Xmatrix=\[1.2 .3 .3 \| .3 1.2 3 \| .3 .3 1.2\] \! (3x3 matrix)

&nbsp;

Symmetrical matrices like this example may also be entered in lower triangle form to be more compact.

&nbsp;

...Xmatrix=\[ 1.2 \| .3 1.2 \| .3 .3 1.2 \] \! (3x3 matrix lower triangle)
