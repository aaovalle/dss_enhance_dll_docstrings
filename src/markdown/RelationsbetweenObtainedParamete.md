# Relations between Obtained Parameters

&nbsp;

In this section, the relation between the pairs of parameters that can be utilized to define the *Vsource* element are presented. As previously mentioned, the pairs are: *S*¯*sc*1 and *S*¯*sc*3; *I*˙*sc*1 and *I*˙*sc*3; *Z*¯0 and *Z*¯1. Note that it is not possible to utilize the pair *Z*¯*s* and *Z*¯*m* to define this element. [Equation 27](<RelationsbetweenObtainedParamete.md#\_bookmark24>) presents the relation between *S*¯*sc*1, *I*˙*sc*1 and *Z*¯*s*, where *E*˙*AB* corresponds to the line-to-line nominal voltage of the element and *Z*¯*s* relates to *Z*¯0 and *Z*¯1 through [*Equation 26*](<Single-PhaseShort-CircuitPoweran.md>).
