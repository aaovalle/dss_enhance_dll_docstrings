&#53;. The results bar, which provides a condensed version of the Results window which can be accessed through Show \> Result Form.

&#54;. Script Windows to directly edit various \*.dss files

&#55;. The Main Script Window is a sort of “notepad” or “interactive window” for OpenDSS. The user can type small commands and run them via the “Do Command” feature (Ctrl‐ + D). The contents of this window are retained between sessions.
