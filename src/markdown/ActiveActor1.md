# ActiveActor

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This option can be used to get or set the active actor. The active actor cannot be higher than NumActors nor lower than 1. Use the commands Get or Set to operate on this value. If the value assigned is the star character (\*), all the commands after setting ActiveActor=\* will be executed for all the actors. This feature only works with the scripting tool or when using the Text interface in COM/DLL.
