# Wait

&nbsp;

This function freezes the execution of the Frontal Panel Actor until all the other actors are available to receive new messages or start new processes. By using this function, it is probable that the user may not be able to see updates on the summary/results tab, but is a very good mechanism for synchronizing all the actors within the parallel environment and make classical scripts compatible with OpenDSS.
