# Parallel

&nbsp;

This function enables/disables the parallel processing functionalities of OpenDSS. By disabling this features, OpenDSS will behave as the classic version of OpenDSS and even if the user can create new actors, each actor will operate sequentially one after the other (no concurrency). By default, this option is disabled and it is required to activate it to gain access to the parallel processing features of OpenDSS.
