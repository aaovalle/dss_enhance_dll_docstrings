# Terminal References

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Terminals are not named separately from the device. Each device will have a name and a defined number of multiphase terminals. Terminals will be referenced explicitly by number \[1, 2, 3 â€¦\] or by inference, in the sequence in which they appear. Internally, they will be sequenced by position in a list.
