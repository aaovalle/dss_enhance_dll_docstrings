# Command Verbs

&nbsp;

Command verbs which do not interact with circuit elements directly (like the Plot and Export commands) initiate a command that take the following form:

&nbsp;

CommandVerb Param1=Val1, Param2='Value 2', Param3=(1 2 3)

&nbsp;

A full list of command verbs is available in the “Executive” section of the help button. Some common command verbs include:

&nbsp;

• New – Create a new circuit element

• Edit – Edit a specified circuit element

• Set – Define solution options, like the mode. See the “options” section of the help for more information.

• Solve – Perform a solution of the current circuit

• Show – Display power flow results in text format. See the “show” section of the help for more information.

• Export – Export power flow results to a text/csv file. See the “export” section of the help for more information.

• Plot – Plot power flow results. See the “plot” section of the help for more information.

&nbsp;

If no command is specified, the Edit command is assumed.
