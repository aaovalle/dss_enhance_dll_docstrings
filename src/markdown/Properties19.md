# Properties

&nbsp;

The properties are, in order:

&nbsp;

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| *Bus1* | Name of bus to which the source's first terminal is connected. Remember to specify the node order if the terminals are connected in some unusual manner. Side effect: The processing of this property results in the setting of the Bus2 property so that all conductors in terminal 2 are connected to ground. For example, Bus1=busname Has the side effect of setting Bus2=busname.0.0.0 |
| *Bus2* | Name of bus to which the sourceâ€™s second terminal is connected. If omitted, the second terminal is connected to ground (node 0) at the bus designated by the Bus1 property. |
| *basekv* | base or rated Line-to-line kV. |
| *pu* | Actual per unit at which the source is operating. Assumed balanced for all phases. |
| *Angle* | Base angle, degrees, of the first phase. |
| *Frequency* | frequency of the source. |
| *Phases* | Number of phases. Default = 3.0. |
| *MVAc3* | &#51;-phase short circuit MVA= kVBase2 / ZSC |
| *MVAsc1* | &#49;-phase short circuit MVA. There is some ambiguity concerning the meaning of this quantity For the DSS, it is defined as kVBase2 / Z1-phase where Z1-phase = 1/3 (2Z1+Z0) Thus, unless a neutral reactor is used, it should be a number on the same order of magnitude as Mvasc3. |
| *x1r1* | Ratio of X1/R1. Default = 4.0. |
| *x0r0* | Ratio of X0/R0. Default = 3.0. |
| *Isc3* | Alternate method of defining the source impedance. 3-phase short circuit current, amps. Default is 10000. |
| *Isc1* | Alternate method of defining the source impedance. single-phase short circuit current, amps. Default is 10500. |
| *R1* | Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Positive-sequence resistance, ohms. Default is 1.65. |
| *X1* | Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Positive-sequence reactance, ohms. Default is 6.6. |
| *R0* | Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Zero-sequence resistance, ohms. Default is 1.9. |
| *X0* | Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Zero-sequence reactance, ohms. Default is 5.7. |
| *ScanType* | {pos\*\| zero \| none} Maintain specified symmetrical component sequence to assume for Harmonic mode solution. Default is positive sequence. Otherwise, angle between phases rotates freely with harmonic. |
| *Sequence* | {pos\*\| neg \| zero} Set the phase angle relationships for the specified symmetrical component sequence for solution modes other than Harmonics. Default is positive sequence. |
| *Spectrum* | Name of harmonic spectrum for this source. Default is "defaultvsource", which is defined when the DSS starts. |
| *Z1* | Positive-sequence impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: Z1=\[1, 2\] \! represents 1 + j2 If defined, Z1, Z2, and Z0 are used to define the impedance matrix of the Vsource. Z1 MUST BE DEFINED TO USE THIS OPTION FOR DEFINING THE MATRIX. Side Effect: Sets Z2 and Z0 to same values unless they were previously defined. (Same rules as the Reactor element.) |
| *Z2* | Negative-sequence impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: Z2=\[1, 2\] \! represents 1 + j2 Used to define the impedance matrix of theVsource. Note: Z2 defaults to Z1 if it is not specifically defined. If Z2 is not equal to Z1, the impedance matrix is asymmetrical. If the Vsource is close to a generator or represents a generator, you may want to set Z2 somewhat lower than Z1 to show the proper behavior for harmonics and unbalanced loading. |
| *Z0* | Zero-sequence impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: Z0=\[3, 4\] \! represents 3 + j4 Used to define the impedance matrix of the Vsource if Z1 is also specified. Note: Z0 defaults to Z1 if it is not specifically defined. |
| *puZ1* | Per-unit positive-sequence impedance on base of Vsource BasekV and BaseMVA. See Z1 definition. Transmission system short circuit equivalents are often expressed in per unit and this offers a convenient way to enter those values. Be sure to specify BaseMVA property if different than the common 100 MVA. |
| *puZ2* | See Z2 property. Per-unit negative-sequence impedance on base of Vsource BasekV and BaseMVA. |
| *puZ0* | See Z0 property. Per-unit zero-sequence impedance on base of Vsource BasekV and BaseMVA. |
| *baseMVA* | Default value is 100. Base used to convert values specifiied with puZ1, puZ0, and puZ2 properties to ohms on kV base specified by BasekV property. |
| *BaseFreq* | Base Frequency for impedance specifications. Default is 60 Hz. |
| *like* | Name of an existing Vsource object on which to base this one. |
