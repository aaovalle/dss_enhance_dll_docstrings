# Circuit

&nbsp;

This interface can be used to gain access to the features and properties of the active circuit. This is one of the most important interfaces since it embeds other interfaces, providing access to them as a property declaration. The circuit interface is exposed directly by the OpenDSSEngine.

&nbsp;

*Example*

&nbsp;

% Create DSS object

DSSObject = actxserver('OpenDSSEngine.DSS')

if ~DSSObject.Start(0),

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; disp("Unable to start openDSS");

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return

end;

DSSCircuit = DSSObject.ActiveCircuit;
