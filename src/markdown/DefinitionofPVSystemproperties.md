# Definition of PVSystem properties

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The properties needed to define a PVSystem element in OpenDSS can be separated into 3 groups:

1. [PV array properties](<PVarrayproperties.md>);
1. [PV inverter properties](<PVinverterproperties.md>);
1. [Operating conditions properties](<Operatingconditionsproperties.md>).

These groups are described separately in this section.
