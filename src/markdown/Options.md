When activated (True), OpenDSS will start the &nbsp; initialization routine for the A-Diakoptics solution mode |
| Algorithm | {Normal \| Newton \| NCIM}&nbsp; Solution algorithm type.&nbsp; Normal is a fixed point iteration that is a little quicker than the Newton iteration.&nbsp; Normal is adequate for most radial distribution circuits.&nbsp; Newton is more robust for circuits that are difficult to solve.NCIM or the N Conductor Current Injection Method is a Newton-Raphson based method to be used for Transmission like cases. |

| Allowduplicates | {YES/TRUE \| NO/FALSE} &nbsp; Default is No. Flag to indicate if it is OK to have devices of same name in the same class. If No, then a New command is treated as an Edit command. If Yes, then a New command will always result in a device being added. |
| Autobuslist | Array of bus names to include in AutoAdd searches. Or, you can specify a text file holding the names, one to a line, by using the syntax (file=filename) instead of the actual array elements. Default is null, which results in the program using either the buses in the EnergyMeter object zones or, if no EnergyMeters, all the buses, which can make for lengthy solution times. &nbsp; Examples: &nbsp; &nbsp; Set autobuslist=(bus1, bus2, bus3, ... ) &nbsp; &nbsp; Set autobuslist=(file=buslist.txt) |

Set to OFF to prevent controls from changing.&nbsp; STATIC = Time does not advance.&nbsp; Control actions are executed in order of shortest time to act until all actions are cleared from the control queue.&nbsp; Use this mode for power flow solutions which may require several regulator tap changes per solution.&nbsp; EVENT = solution is event driven.&nbsp; Only the control actions nearest in time are executed and the time is advanced automatically to the time of the event. &nbsp; TIME = solution is time driven.&nbsp; Control actions are executed when the time for the pending action is reached or surpassed.&nbsp; Controls may reset and may choose not to act when it comes their time. &nbsp; Use TIME mode when modeling a control externally to the DSS and a solution mode such as DAILY or DUTYCYCLE that advances time, or set the time (hour and sec) explicitly from the external program.&nbsp; |
| Coverage | Percentage of coverage expected when estimating the longest paths on the circuit for tearing, the default coverage&nbsp; is the 90% (0.9), this value cannot exceed 1.0.

| CPU | (default -1)Gets/Sets the CPU to be used by the active actor. If negative (-1) means that the actor affinity is to all the CPUs and will be executed in the&nbsp; first available CPU and will be reallocated into another CPU dynamically if the operating system requires it.

The elements of the vector must be complex numbers (e.g. 1+2j). |
| IntegrationFlag | Returns the value of the integration flag during a dynamics simulation. This flag is useful when developing models such as pyControls designed for dynamics simulations. If the user attemps to read this flag using other simulation methods (COM, DLL, , EXE), this flag will always return the same value (not variable). |
| ITerminal | Use this command to set/get the current injection vector at the terminals of the active PC Element. If the active element is not a PCE, the program will return an error message aborting the command (see "select"). &nbsp; These currents are the equivalent of the nonlinear contribution of the model. For example, for a constant PQ load it will be conj(((P + Qj)/Nph)/Volt), where P + Qj is the power rating, Nph is the number of phases, and Volt is the voltage (complex) at the terminal of the PCE.

Applies to EnergyMeter and Generator objects.&nbsp; Default method simply multiplies the present value of the registers times the width of the interval (Euler). Trapezoidal is more accurate when there are sharp changes in a load shape or unequal intervals. Trapezoidal is automatically used for some load-duration curve simulations where the interval size varies considerably. Keep in mind that for Trapezoidal, you have to solve one more point than the number of intervals. That is, to do a Daily simulation on a 24-hr load shape, you would set Number=25 to force a solution at the first point again to establish the last (24th) interval.&nbsp; Note: Set Mode= resets Trapezoidal to No/False. Set this to Yes/True AFTER setting the Mode option. |

| UseMyLinkBranches | {YES/TRUE \| NO/FALSE\*} Set/get the boolean flag for indicating to the tearing algorithm the source of the link branches for tearing the model into sub-circuits. If FALSE, OpenDSS will use METIS for estimating the link branches to be used based on the number of sub-circuits given by the user through the command "set Num\_SubCircuits".Otherwise, OpenDSS will use the list of link branches given by the user with the command "set LinkBranches". |

The defaults are as shown in the example above.&nbsp; |
