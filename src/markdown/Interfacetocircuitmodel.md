# Interface to circuit model

PVSystem is considered to be a PC element that is modeled by a Norton equivalent in which the constant and linear Norton admittance is included in *Y*Â¯*system* and the nonlinear characteristics are represented by the compensation current sources. The Norton equivalent is calculated based on the present output power delivered to the circuit (grid), as presented in the sub subsection 1.2.1, and a few PVSystem properties.
