# Support

This is essentially the opposite of PeakShave mode. The fleet is dispatched to keep the power in the monitored terminal at or above*kWTarget*. The typical application would be to support renewable generation when power output falls off to events like cloud transients. The power monitored is assumed normally negative (see Example [7.3](<References2.md#\_bookmark24>)). [*Figure 4*](<Schedule.md>) illustrates the operation of the controller in this mode.
