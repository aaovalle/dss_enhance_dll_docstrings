# Control Mode 5 (Mode=5)

&nbsp;

In control mode 5 the user can define the same GAP using two set points as in control [mode 4](<ControlMode4Mode4.md>). The only difference between mode 5 and mode 4 is that in mode 5, the UPFC controller performs dual control actions just as in control [mode 3](<ControlMode3Mode3.md>).
