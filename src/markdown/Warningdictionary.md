| ***Message generator*** | ***Message code*** | ***Message*** | ***How to deal with it*** |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| DSSForms.pas/cpp | &#57;904 | illegal command: show control panel.' | There is an external call to launch the control panel, however, the call has incomplete arguments. Check the arguments, the panel will try to launch using the default values, it may fail and derive into a system error. |
| DSSForms.pas/cpp | &#57;903 | 'illegal command: show help form.' | When calling the help form there was an error, either the form cannot be created (system error) or there is an error internally when creating the window. This type of errors are the result of an bug in the code and needs to be solved internally. |
| DSSForms.pas/cpp | &#57;902 | 'illegal command: show property edit form.' | When calling the routine for creating the property edit form an exception was caught.This can be the product of a programming error in the active class, it could be given a recent update or edit on the class, adin/removing properties and/or values. Review the class triggering this error, otherwise, it is possible that the routine for creating the form was modified and a bug was introduced.&nbsp; |
| DSSForms.pas/cpp | &#57;901 | &nbsp;'no forms to close.' | All the floating forms around the OpenDSS environment are closed or are not registered in the forms list. This is of informative character. |
| DSSForms.pas/cpp | &#57;900 | 'registration form not valid for this version' | This is an outdated warning message making reference to the registration of a form. In normal conditions and with nowadays compilers this exception should never be reached. No additional information found. |
| AutoAdd.pas/cpp | &#52;38 | error trying to append to ' + fname + crlf + &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e.message | This warning means that there was an error when trying to append the name of an element added automatically through the "AutoAdd" command into the active report. This could be generated by one of the following circumstances: The report file was open when tring to write it. Another application open the file in the middle of the writing process. The software has no write permission at the location of the file in the hard drive. The element created has no name of has errors (programming error).&nbsp; |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;23 | 'exception freeing circuit element:'&nbsp; + elemname + crlf + e.message | This exception is generated when calling a “Clear” or “ClearAll” command normally, refers to an internal error when clearing the memory variables for a specific class. This error is triggered by an internal memory problem created by the “Destructor” routine on a class. The solution resides in checking on the class “Destructor”. This is a programmatic bug. We have observed that sometimes an operating system experiencing malfunctions and memory access problems can also trigger this message. |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#53;008 | 'line "'+s+'" not found in active circuit.' | This warning message means that the given line when asking for the name of the bus at one of the line’s terminals does not exist. There is an issue with the line name provided or the command arguments are incorrect. |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;30 | cannot compute system capacity with energymeter objects\!' | When using the routine for calculating capacity it is important to have at least 1 energy meter. If there are no energy meters declared for the circuit, this warning message will show up. |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;31 | 'cannot compute system capacity with no ue resisters defined.&nbsp; use set ueregs=(...) command.' | This exception is triggered by the lack of UE or Unserved Energy registers for the active energy meter when calculating capacity. These registers are defined by using the option “UERegs” ( https://opendss.epri.com/Options.html ). See also https://opendss.epri.com/CapacityCommand.html and https://opendss.epri.com/TechNoteAutoAddSolutionMode.html . |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;32 | 'could not create a folder "'+dir+'" for saving the circuit.' | When executing the command “save” with the argument “circuit”, the folder location assigned in the hard drive doesn’t exist or is not writable. In this case, try a different folder and make sure that you don’t need administrative privileges to write at the folder specified. |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;33 | 'circuit saved in directory: ' + getcurrentdir | It’s a notification for letting the user know that the circuit model was saved in the given directory. |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;34 | 'error attempting to save circuit in ' + getcurrentdir | When executing the command “save” with the argument “circuit”, the folder location assigned in the hard drive doesn’t exist or is not writable. In this case, try a different folder and make sure that you don’t need administrative privileges to write at the folder specified. |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;3501 | 'error saving busvoltagebases file: '+e.message | The bus voltages report cannot be written at the location assigned in the hard drive, it is because it probably doesn’t exist or is not writable. In this case, try a different folder and make sure that you don’t need administrative privileges to write at the folder specified. |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;35 | 'error saving master file: '+e.message | When saving the circuit model, the file master.dss cannot be written at the location assigned in the hard drive, it is because it probably doesn’t exist, it is not writable or there was an error when redirecting the other files and sub-classes derived from the circuit (this last option is very unlikely, but it happens sometimes when the user has added new features to a class). In this case, try a different folder and make sure that you don’t need administrative privileges to write at the folder specified. If the error persists, then the problem is a programmatic one, forcing the user to review the source code and correct the issue produced. |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;36 | 'cannot create directory: '+currdir | When saving the feeders zones, or feeders downstream an energy meter, the folder for the feeder cannot be created at the location assigned in the hard drive, it is because it probably doesn’t exist, it is not writable or there was an error when redirecting the other files and sub-classes derived from the circuit (this last option is very unlikely, but it happens sometimes when the user has added new features to a class). In this case, try a different folder and make sure that you don’t need administrative privileges to write at the folder specified. If the error persists, then the problem is a programmatic one, forcing the user to review the source code and correct the issue produced. |
| Circuit.pas/cpp | &#52;37 | 'error creating buscoords.dss.' | When saving the circuit model, the file buscoords.dss cannot be written at the location assigned in the hard drive, it is because it probably doesn’t exist, it is not writable or there was an error when extracting the bus coordinates across the model (this last option is very unlikely, but it happens sometimes when the user has added new features to the bus class). In this case, try a different folder and make sure that you don’t need administrative privileges to write at the folder specified. If the error persists, then the problem is a programmatic one, forcing the user to review the source code and correct the issue produced. |
| CktElement.pas/cpp | &#55;49 | format('invalid number of terminals (%d) for "%s.%s"',&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \[value, parentclass.name, name \]) | This exception is triggered when defining the number of terminals of a declared element, in this case, the number of terminals was entered as a negative number.

| CktElement.pas/cpp | &#55;50 | format('warning: number of conductors is very large (%d) for circuit element: "%s.%s.' + &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'possible error in specifying the number of phases for element.', &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \[fnconds, parentclass.name, name\]) | This exception is triggered when defining the number of conductors of an element recently declared, in this case, the number of conductors exceeds 101. Check the number of conductors definition for the element you are trying to declare and make sure that the number of conductors does not exceed this limit (101). |
| CktElement.pas/cpp | &#55;541 | format('attempt to set bus name for non-existent circuit element terminal(%d): "%s"',\[i, s\]) | This exception is triggered when the number of terminals of the element recently declared is lower than the number of buses assigned to it. To prevent this situation, make sure that the number of buses used when declaring the object does not exceed the number of terminals. For instance, a line has only 2 terminals. Consequently, it can have only 2 bus names assigned, 1 per terminal. |
| CktElement.pas/cpp | &#55;54 | 'virtual proc recalcelementdata in base cktelement class called for device = "' + name +'"' | This warning message results the routine for recalculating the active element data is not properly overridden at the child class.
