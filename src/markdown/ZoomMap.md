&nbsp;

Zoom the map in the area described with the coordinates defined at the option GISCoords. This command doesnâ€™t have arguments, but it requires the user to previously define the coordinates for the area of interest as follows:

&nbsp;

set GISCoords=\[myLong1,myLat1,myLong2,myLat2\]

&nbsp;

myLong1 and myLat1 represent the top left corner (longitude and latitude) of the rectangle describing the area of interest. myLong2 and myLat2 are the bottom right corner of the area of interest.
