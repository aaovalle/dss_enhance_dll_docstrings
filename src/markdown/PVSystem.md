# PVSystem

&nbsp;

Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the PVSystem element model that is implemented in OpenDSS version 9 and above. The model combines the photovoltaic (PV) array and the PV inverter. It assumes that the inverter is capable of tracking the maximum power point (mpp) of the panel quickly, allowing adequate use in QSTS simulations with a time step of at least one second. This considerably facilitates PV modeling and is an adequate assumption for most interconnection impact studies.
