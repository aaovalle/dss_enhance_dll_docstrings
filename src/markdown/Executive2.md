| YearlyCurves |  \[cases=\](case1, case2, ...) \[registers=\](reg1, reg2, ...)&nbsp; \[meter=\]{Totals\* \| SystemMeter \| metername}Plots yearly curves for specified cases and registers. &nbsp; Default: meter=Totals. Example: &nbsp; yearlycurves cases=(basecase, pvgens) registers=9&nbsp; |
| Ysc |  Returns full Ysc matrix for the ACTIVE BUS in comma-separated complex number form G + jB.&nbsp; |
| Zsc |  Returns full Zsc matrix for the ACTIVE BUS in comma-separated complex number form.&nbsp; |
| Zsc012 |  Returns symmetrical component short circuit impedances Z0, Z1, and Z2 for the ACTIVE 3-PHASE BUS. Determined from Zsc matrix.&nbsp; |
| Zsc10 |  Returns symmetrical component impedances, Z1, Z0 for the ACTIVE BUS in comma-separated R+jX form.&nbsp; |
| ZscRefresh |  Refreshes Zsc matrix for the ACTIVE BUS.&nbsp; |
