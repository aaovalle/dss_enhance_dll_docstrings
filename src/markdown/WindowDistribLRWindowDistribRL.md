# WindowDistribLR/WindowDistribRL

&nbsp;

This automated functionality allows users to redistribute OpenDSS and OpenDSS-GIS windows across the screen. With WindowDistribLR, OpenDSS will divide the screen in the half (horizontaly) and will locate OpenDSS to the left, leaving OpenDSS-GIS to the right as shown at Figure 30. Otherwise, WindowDistribRL puts OpenDSS to the right of the screen and OpenDSS-GIS to the left as shown at Figure 31.
