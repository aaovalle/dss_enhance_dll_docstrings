# Tear_Circuit

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This command tears apart the circuit in many pieces as CPUs – 1 are available in the local PC. The tearing takes place by using the CalcIncMatrix\_O command internally. Then, the algorithm estimates the best route for generating a set of sub-Circuits by placing an energy meter at the tearing points selected by the algorithm. As a result, this command will generate a folder called Torn\_Circuit inside the project’s folder. Each sub-Circuit will be contained in this folder starting at the substation (Torn\_Circuit folder root) and the other Sub-Circuits in folders called Zone\_1, Zone\_2 and so on until the total number of sub-Circuits.
