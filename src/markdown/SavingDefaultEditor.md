# Saving Default Editor

&nbsp;

The default external text editor assumed by the OpenDSS is Notepad.exe, which should be on all Windows systems in some form or another. This editor is often inadequate for making complicated changes to large scripts. Therefore, most users prefer to assign another text editor. For example, at EPRI many users prefer Editplus. We have templates for DSS scripts and colorcoded keywords defined for many functions. Other users prefer TextPad and a myriad of other editors.

&nbsp;

An editor that allows selection of columns is a definite advantage. You can use the File \| Align File ... menu command to align the fields in a script file, which makes it easier to work on columns of script properties.

&nbsp;

To set another default editor, use the command

&nbsp;

Set Editor=(full path name of editor exe file)

&nbsp;

Upon exiting, the DSS will remember this setting, so you need only execute this command one time.
