# TechNote Default Path name

&nbsp;

The OpenDSS changes the default path when you open a file in a DSS window. Therefore, you do not always have to set the path in the Compile command or in a separate Set Datapath= --- option.

&nbsp;

The present data path is always displayed in the window header. If you change to another path, you can get back to the first by *rightclicking in a window for a file from the desired path* and selecting "*Change to this Directory*" from the popup window.

&nbsp;

You may still use Compile command or the Set Datapath option to set the default datapath if you find that more readable.
