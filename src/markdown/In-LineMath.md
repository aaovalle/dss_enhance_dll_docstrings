# In-Line Math

&nbsp;

The DSS scripting language uses a form of Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) to accommodate in-line math. This feature may be used to pre-process input data before simulation. The parser will evaluate RPN expressions automatically if you enclose the expression in any of the quoted formats (quotation marks or any of the matched parentheses, brackets, etc.).
