# Default

In this mode, the triggers follow the specified loadshape corresponding to the present solution mode (properties *daily*, *yearly* and *dutycycle*). When the value of the loadshape is greater than the value specified in *DischargeTrigger*, the storage discharges at a constant power, defined by %*Discharge*. The discharging continues until either the SOC reaches %*reserve* or the value from the curve assumes a value less than *DischargeTrigger*. Analogously, when the value of the loadshape is less than the specified *ChargeTrigger*, the storage charges until either it is fully charged or the loadshape value becomes greater than *DischargeTrigger*. Besides that, time criteria, if active, has priority over the triggers. Time criteria is defined by the property *TimeChargeTrigger*, which corresponds to the time of the day when the storage charging is activated, even if the value from the specified loadshape is not less than *ChargeTrigger*. This mechanism can be utilized, e.g., to charge the storage at the beginning of the day, when the demand is low, to ensure that the storage is fully charged to be discharged during the rest of the day. By default, *TimeChargeTrigger* is active and equal to 2 (2am). To disable this feature, assign any negative value to this property.

The discharging continues until either the SOC reaches %*reserve* or the value from the curve assumes a value less than *DischargeTrigger*. In a similar way, whenever the value from the curve is less than the specified *ChargeTrigger* the element charges until either it is fully charged or the curve assumes a value greater than *DischargeTrigger*. Besides the aforementioned rules, there is another criteria that, when active, has priority over the triggers. It is a time criteria and it is defined by the property *TimeChargeTrigger*. It corresponds to the time of the day when the storage charging is activated, even if the value from the specified loadshape is not less than *ChargeTrigger*. This mechanism is normally utilized to charge the storage at the beginning of the day, when the demand is low, to ensure that the element is fully charged for operation during the rest of the day. By default, *TimeChargeTrigger* is active and equal to 2 (2am). To disable this feature, assign any negative value to his property.
