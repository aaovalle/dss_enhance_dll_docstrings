# DSSProperty

&nbsp;

This interface allows to gain direct access to the active properties of the active element without having to go through the text interface or specific interfaces. It is not exposed directly and can be accessed through the ActiveDSSElement interface. It applies only for a single property at the time.

&nbsp;

*Example*

&nbsp;

% Create DSS object

DSSObject = actxserver('OpenDSSEngine.DSS')

if ~DSSObject.Start(0),

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; disp("Unable to start openDSS");

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return

end;

DSSCircuit = DSSObject.ActiveCircuit;

DSSElement = DSSCircuit.ActiveDSSElement;
