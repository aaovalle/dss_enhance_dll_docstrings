# Examples

In this section, several examples are presented to show the operation of the storage element in each of the self-dispatch modes listed in [*Table 1*](<DispatchModes.md#\_bookmark13>). For simplicity, a small circuit containing a single storage connected to a voltage source will be utilized, as shown in [Figure 5](<Examples2.md#\_bookmark16>).

In the first example, several aspects of the model operation will be described in details. In the following examples, the focus will be given to the aspects related to the storage dispatch itself.
