# Standard Way to define Array Properties

\
Arrays can be defined by the following methods:

\-Entering the numeric values directly

&nbsp;

...mult=\[1, 2, 3, 4, ...\]

&nbsp;

\-Entering the numbers from a single column text file:

&nbsp;

...mult=\[File=MyTextDataFile.CSV\]

&nbsp;

\-Entering the data from a packed binary file of doubles:

&nbsp;

...mult=\[dblFile=MyFileOfDoubles.dbl\]

&nbsp;

\-Entering the data from a packed binary file of singles:

&nbsp;

...mult=\[sngFile=MyFileOfDoubles.sng\]
